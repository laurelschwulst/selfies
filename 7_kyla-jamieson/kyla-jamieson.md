Series of five self-portraits:

1. Is a bathroom mirror selfie from last summer, when I had a tan. I’m wrapped in a white towel and my wet hair is slicked back. Warm sunlight coming through an off-stage doorway illuminates my face, neck, and the centre of my chest.

2. An uncherished loyalty card on muddy ground next to a sidewalk and some scraggly grass. Only one of the squares has been stamped. The scene is sunlit.

3. A jar of pickles framed by a cutout for serving food in the plexiglass at a closed beachside concession stand. The jar sits on a metal counter, with painted green board behind it and the plexiglass. Reflected in the plexiglass is a blue sky and mountains over which white clouds linger.

4. Video of a metallic pinwheel spinning in the wind. It’s stuck in the dirt of a white sidewalk planter filled with brown stubs and bare dirt. It faces the base of a telephone pole with what appears to be pastel green fungi growing on it, and there is green grass around the planter.

5. Sidewalk cracks with one tiny little weed growing up.
