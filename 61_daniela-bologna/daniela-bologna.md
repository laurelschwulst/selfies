Daniela is there but barely. Soft dark ringlets, slight scowl, a blur of a hand motioning somewhere, someplace. Her ears bear two sister earrings: one, a smiley face made from wood and painted mahonia yellow, the other, her downturned counterpart. Misty eyes offer up tears that cling to her cheeks. She is staring towards the camera, but she is looking at herself.
