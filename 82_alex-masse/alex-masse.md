Alex's looks up to the winter clouds and the sun bursting through them, wearing a grin of uninhibited glee. In this timed selfie, they are caught mid-stim, one hand aflutter at their side and another slightly raised. They don several layers of several patterns, a self-made collage of stripes, flannel, and plaid. Snow sticks to their skirt and kisses their dark curls, their pale fingers flushed in the cold. They are at peace, framed by frosted evergreens.
