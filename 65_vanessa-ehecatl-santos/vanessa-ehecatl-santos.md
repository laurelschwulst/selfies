A Queer femme indigenous interdisciplinary artist finding the sunset @ Lake Abiquiu in NM located two mi from their home. The subject is positioned in the last remaining rays of the bleeding sunset on a perfectly outcropped peach rock as an expert sunset chaser would. On the edge of an ancient ocean crimson red stone bed while hues of lavender, sky blue, heavenly pink and deep juicy orange co-mingle in the sky. The water infused with the power of the sacred spider grandma dances and sparkles in the background behind the artist who is also wearing a black bra, indigo blue garter, black lace underwear and neon green fishnets while they reach up with heavy arms towards the dragon sprite clouds above.
