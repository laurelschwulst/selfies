The mottled bullseye of spider angioma below Chrisâ€™s left eye (appearing right) bedazzles the bags found there. A titled thinking animal and somemany, his right ear (appearing left) lets the ceiling veer toward the seer. Lips tilt opposite. Orange, red, and white abound as clothing and beard. His look clarifies that he has already decided to love you.
