A white cherub-faced woman with rainbow hair gazes lovingly at her little black doggie. He is in her arms, licking the bottom of her chin. They stand in front of a large deep green bush covered in bright pink flowers. The sun is warm on their faces, and there is a slight breeze. It smells like a freshly mowed lawn. In this moment of bliss they can hear the buzzing of bees, lawn mowers, and city traffic.
