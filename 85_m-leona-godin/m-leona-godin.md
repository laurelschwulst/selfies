With a mischievous smile I’m leaning toward a vibrantly violet-colored gin and tonic that sits on the wood picnic table in front of me. The drink matches my sunglass lenses and luscious Violet Ambrosia perfume. My ‘70’s blouse has a lace-trimmed square neckline that gathers the groovy, multi-colored striped and polka-dotted polyester material into loose folds. Around my neck hangs a silver and blue-stone evil-eye pendant and my earrings are dangly, silver molecular botanical metal cutout designs. I’ve got palish skin, long, straight brown hair, and am wearing lipstick—violet-colored, of course!
