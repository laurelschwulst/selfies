Wearing their Γιαγιά’s fancy embroidered floral dress, Alexa Dexa sits at a table sized for a toddler and cuts plastic vegetables with a wooden toy knife. Their teddy bear sits in a tiny chair to their right. On their left is a toy refrigerator, a toy sink, and a toy stove, all pastel pink. Above the toy sink is a painting of a window with pink curtains, a plant, and a bird flying by. The wallpaper is made up of crayon drawings of different kinds of flowers in different colors. In this world that commands them to #BeADoll, Alexa becomes unable to determine whether they are actually a person or a doll.
