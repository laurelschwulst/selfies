*Note - I often upload a group of images on instagram and write alt text for the whole group in a number list.*

1. Selfie of me wearing a bright green short wig with glittery blue-green eyeshadow and a collared button up shirt with a dark lead pattern by @rebirthgarments

2. Selfie of me with bruised eye makeup with tears of blood streaming down my cheeks as the pain of neoliberal imperialism seeps into my eyeballs

3. Selfie of me with @deebledabble at Jai Ho; I have black skull makeup on and a colorful button up shirt by @rebirthgarments and dark blue blazer; Adeeba has a white shirt and long red scarf because she's Anjali, the woman Rahul did not treat well
