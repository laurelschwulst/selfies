Lil Miss Hot Mess, a drag queen dressed in tacky clothes inspired by Yetta from The Nanny (animal prints, sequins, rhinestones, and a visor) sits with a bingo cage and board, cheekily flashing a peace sign after hosting virtual bingo for queer senior citizens from her bedroom during the Covid-19 pandemic. She stares just slightly off-camera as if to say: “I don’t make the rules, she’s a bingo queen now.” Lil Miss Hot Mess is a white Jewish drag queen—once described as having a “peaches and cream” complexion by the drag legend Vaginal Davis—with a dirty blonde wig and glittery eyes and lips that somehow managed to stay on for over an hour before this photo was taken.
