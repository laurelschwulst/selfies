A shadowy photograph, in colour. A close up on a hand, softly and proudly holding a shiny pink cane by its handle. The person’s skin is white and the cane’s braided pink strap hangs from the wrist. There’s a scrunchie visible on the wrist too and it’s made of a bright orange, red and black flame print fabric. In the background, we see the shadowy lower half of the face of the cane holder. A side glance. A big soft furry black and white sweater. A golden Aries medallion hanging round the neck. Glossy wet fuchsia lips.
