Outside of Baltimore, I’m turned to the side, gazing at a tiger striped greyhound’s long, mellow face. My lips are almost in the  shape to whistle though I don’t remember making such a sound. I  am white, non- binary, with soft hair growing on my face, thick brown curls on my head. I wear a dark green shirt with a crackled  texture, rolled once at the short sleeves. Two tattoos are slightly  visible (the downcast bluish edge of a magnolia blossom on my  upper arm and the faded brown vertical bars on my forearm). The  greyhound’s bright pink tongue curls fantastically around their  nose and whitening muzzle. Their eyes are almost closed; their  eyelashes appear silvery in the overcast light. They wear two  collars, a green martingale from the rescue group, and the one  we’ve given her, a faux diamond collar, now missing every fifth or  so gem. To take this selfie, we have paused on the wooded path  and have found a moment to rest and play.
