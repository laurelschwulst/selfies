Thai’s hand reaches out from the left upper-side of the image, gesturing as if to grab something. Their hand is wrapped in semi-transparent dressings covering their raw skin that peaks out between each dressing pad. There is a bunched pile of dressings on their wrist that resembles the flowers in a corsage. Thai’s hand is rested on a single piece of plush paper towel on a white background.
