Aditi is looking at her reflection on the phone screen as she stands in her parentsâ€™ bedroom. On her head rests a bright red swimming cap with strings. It is untied and her curls poke out from under it. This will be her first dip in the pool this week, and in three years. She may wear an unimpressed expression on her face but is in fact overjoyed by the prospect of floating in the water.
