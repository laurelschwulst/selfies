[Image description: A black-and-white photo of a middle-aged white guy sitting at the window of a cafe. Above his head, the window of the cafe features five icons similar to those found on iPhones. The icons indicate: coffee, Instagram, food, Wi-Fi, and croissants. The man often tries to avoid having his photo taken, preferring to be the one taking the photo. He sits awkwardly pretending to write with a pen in his hand and with his head looking down at his notebook. His slender index finger on his right hand, the one holding a pen, has some dried blood next to the nail due to a neglected hangnail. His left hand is rubbing his chin which sports three day old stubble. He wears thick, black rimmed prescription glasses, a dark toque that has scruffs of hair sticking out at the front and the back, a well-worn custom made t-shirt featuring a collage by Winston Hacking, slightly dirty blue jeans and a pair of black sneakers that have large white stains due to the walking through melting snow mixed with street salt.]
