The smile of her mother. The face shape of her father. The scar on her hip from playing tag with her sister. The mouth that was fed by her grandmother. The radical heart of her grandfather. The albinism of an ancestor she’s never met. The first body modification she’s made for herself, an unlucky four piercings, still feel wrong. She loves the people who’ve shaped her. Maybe one day she’ll love the sum of these parts.
