This photo was taken exactly 10 years ago by someone who I love and miss. We havenâ€™t spoken in almost as many years. I am grinning atop a red bed, grinning in anticipation for the fun we are about to have. Next to me are two bowls, containing two cheap cream eclairs that barely fit inside, and an ancient laptop open on Tumblr, where we are about to source sad quotes placed over images of oceans, and subsequently laugh our heads off.
