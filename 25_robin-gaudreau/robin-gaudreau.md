Bisexually sitting across the arms of a plush velour sitting chair, Robin hugs one knee to their chest. Invisible yet ever present are mood disorder and chronic pain. They are looking at the night out the window to the left, the soft light of a single lamp softly touching their brown skin and curly hair.
