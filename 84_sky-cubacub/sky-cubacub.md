Sky Cubacub, a filipinx neuroqueer wearing a pink scalemaille headpiece, pink and lavender metamaille chainmaille Filipinx butterfly sleeve crop top over a zig zag colorblocked unitard and oversized pink Rebirth Garments Logo laser cut earrings, is snarling at the camera and holding their fist up to show off a silver ring by Wabisabi Opals of the Queercrip symbol that Sky designed. Xey have white grid makeup over the top half of their face, black spikey triangle eyeliner under one eye, and a dark blue asymmetrical lip. They are in a white geodesic dome greenhouse with large plants in the background.
