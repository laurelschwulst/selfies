I am standing in the middle of a grassy field in Scotland, it is almost night time, and there are wispy clouds in the sky. A gray brick train station is behind me in the distance. I have long brown hair that is blowing in the wind and over my face, it is chilly and the air smells like wet dirt. My eyes are half closed, and my lips are partially open, like I am about to say something. I’m wearing a heavy denim coat, a blue skirt with white flowers on it, and black Doc Martens. My legs are covered in goosebumps, and I am tired from the journey to Glasgow. In my left hand, I am holding onto my guide dog London’s leash, she is a golden Labrador Retriever. She’s standing next to me, and looking at the camera. Her ears are alert and perky, and the flash from the camera is reflecting in her eyes.
