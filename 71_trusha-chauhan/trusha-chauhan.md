Things seen: A woman after a haircut. A glowing pink smile animates her face but is pierced shut indicating an unsettled rumbling inside her. Black hair is blown out to perfection. Smoothed tresses sweep across the sharp edges of her jaw and rest softly on her chest. Things unseen: The taming of Medusaâ€™s ringleted mane with a potion made of tears wept for unrequited love. The elixir was spritzed on her twisted strands and then activated with heat until the neutralisation was complete.
