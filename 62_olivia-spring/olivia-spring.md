A photo of myself, a white woman with short brown hair and bangs, looking glum. My left palm is cupping my chin, supporting the weight of my head. My eyelids are weights that I can barely keep open after spending all day entwined with fatigue. I will leave my house in about an hour, and no one will be able to tell that Iâ€™ve been sick for 14 years.
