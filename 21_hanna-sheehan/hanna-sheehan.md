I appear on the screen of a CCTV reader which is placed on a desk. I am a white, femme presenting non-binary person with albinism. I have short blonde hair, bangs, and a septum piercing. I took this selfie with my iPhone, which is out of frame. The screen around me is teal and I am wearing an off white knit sweater. There is a computer monitor next to the CCTV and a large print keyboard in front of it. The room appears to be an office or study room in a library. I seem to be studying or thinking. The tone is pensive and somewhat angsty.
