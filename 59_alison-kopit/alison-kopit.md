A queer femme squints at the camera from a bench in the woods.
Eyes blue, round face a bit crooked,
pale skin warmed by early spring sun.
Birds sing, squirrels rustle against tree bark.
Buried in thought, an unraveling scroll that is
rocks, creeks, dances, heartbreaks long.
Outside, where time unfurls differently.
Time, a little crooked too.
I recognize myself here. I recognize myself when I look a little lost.
When you can see my shoulders, bare
Not in a sexy way
(Maybe in a sexy way?)
But this skin likes to meet the sun and the breeze.
I look like me with my brow furrowed, wrinkles that stay,
Tics echoing across my face.
Is she disoriented? Concerned? Time traveling?
Itâ€™s yes.
Spring emerges in my heart when it emerges from underground.
I am here
I am HERE.
Open open and squint in the sun.
