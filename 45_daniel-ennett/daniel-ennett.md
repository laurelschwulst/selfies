ID: Daniel, a limbless man, smolders in the direction of the camera, he's wearing an earthy yellow ochre suit, with his left shoulder exposed. He has thick rimmed glasses and bedroom eyes (writing your own image descriptions should be illegal).

Image 2: a black and white full-body shot of Daniel looking down at his camera, the light provides a sculptural look at his suit and core, where two necklaces dangle down, one a circle pendant, the other a wrapped cord with a netted rock. With his smarmy, smug, STONEFACED, facade, he betrays what an egregiously sentimental piece-of-shit he is by wearing necklaces hand-crafted for him by someone he loves, the weight of them an ever-present reminder of why he should carry on in this beautiful absurdist hellscape called life.
