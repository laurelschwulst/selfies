A selfie of me, a white person with short wavy brown hair, looking neutrally at the camera in three quarter profile. I am wearing a dangling green and gold pill capsule earring because (unfortunately) Iâ€™m interested in semiotics. I am wearing my new gold glasses, and I like how the prism lens over my left eye is vertically ridged like the wood grain in the background and my sprigged corduroy shirt.
