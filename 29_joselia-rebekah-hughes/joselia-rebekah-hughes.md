[Image Description: Joselia, this instagram’s narrator is celebrating her 32nd birthday. She is sitting on her front verandah on a green metal chair. Her yellow hatted head—Kangol terry cloth bucket— is tilted to the right. Her eyes are facing right, perhaps indicating anticipation for the future of which she knows is simply and expansively as well cultivated presence in present. A white facemask dangles from her ear. She is wearing a spaghetti stap, tie dye print, stretchy one piece outfit that she bought at a local Rainbow. In the background is an aloe plant in a blue pot.]
