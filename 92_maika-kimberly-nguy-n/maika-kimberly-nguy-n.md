Maika Kimberly Nguyá»…n
---
Around her neck is an engraved gold necklace with letters that spell out her name M-A-I-K-A, horizontally. Maika (My-ka) has dark brown hair, sun kissed golden highlights, with curtain bangs that frame her face. Some hairs stick out from her head due to the static that allows it to defy gravity. Her mouth is slightly open, lips pursed, allowing you to see her bottom teeth peeking through. She has golden-olive tone skin and a heart-shaped face. With her head tilted slightly to the right, she stares at the camera blankly. Every time she engages in this movement, she can hear her neck joints stretching inside her. In her dark brown glossy eyes, is a reflection of a ring light that is positioned right across from her. Through pleasure and anxiety, she is looking at her reflection through the selfie camera. Hoping that how she views herself will be the impression of how others see her.
