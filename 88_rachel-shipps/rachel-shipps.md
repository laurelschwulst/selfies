A slightly blurred image centers my hand, semi-artfully posed with thumb and one finger touching, and fingers glittering with violet sparkle polish, in front of a stove and its orange embers; in my mind in the image, I’ve just received news that I am offered what was my favorite job though its pay is not good and my mind is blurry too with disbelief and excitement. It’s the end of what has been a hard autumn, 2014. I’m looking at this picture again and feel an echo of the same heat, the same excitement, the touch of my own finger on the textured nail, and I’m barely conscious of my feet on the carpeted floor, in 2022.
