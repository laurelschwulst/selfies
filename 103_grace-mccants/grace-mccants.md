Grace, a black woman with curly hair tied on top of her head, sits on a green velvet couch holding a small dry erase board with, “F U Mickey” written on it in orange block letters. She’s looking at the camera with a friendly, closed mouth smile - there’s a little pride behind her eyes. Mickey, a white man with dark curly hair and short facial hair, side-eyes Grace disapprovingly from several feet in the background.
