Sam sits cross legged on a pink gaming chair he found on the street. He is looking off into the distance with an expression (he hopes) looks intelligent and contemplative. He is wearing a green checkerboard button up shirt, spider-man pajama bottoms, and rainbow socks. The floor is a dark hardwood with visible scratches and the wall is white with smudges.
