masked museum selfie, featuring: Jacques Hurtubise, Hyacinthe, acrylic on canvas, 1966.

emerging from the isolation of a stay-at-home existence, i seek comfort in the avant-garde. I stand at the fore, compositionally centring my masqueraded self. bruised by a persistent lack of care, i must guard my vulnerable self with joyful adornments of colour. i first encase myself in the warmth of my black, blue, and teal puff jacket, complementing these wintry tones with a brightly coloured green fabric mask. i am framed by the diagonals of a diamond canvas, with the flowing fractal channels of cornflower blue rills and the embankments of red ridges seemingly emanating like sunbeams from my mind. i gaze into the camera, longing for a future, where our
existence is no longer confined to the edges. a future, where our crip joy flows with enduring ease.
