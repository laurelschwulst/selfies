From her childhood bedroom, a 31-year-old Jennifer takes a mirror selfie with her first cane. Like the rest of her outfit, it is black and designed for comfort. She sends the snap to several friends, the smile lingering on her face as she realises this is one of kindness’s many precipices she has previously avoided. Leaping off of it is freeing. The subtle power of this announcement by way of a visual cue cannot be underestimated. Signs and signifiers make the invisible visible. A painting of Stevie Nicks is in the background, eyes bright and holding the night bird. Jennifer’s been listening to her a lot lately, especially Sable on Blond. She knows what it means to “learn to be a stranger,” like her body before pain became.
