This is a photo of me with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth. I'm a white woman sitting on the back porch of an apartment I probably can’t keep, at least not for any real amount of time. I look like I think I’m cool in this photo, like I’ve got real things to say, things like: “part of having somebody in the room with you is keeping them coming.” With a cigarette bouncing on my lip, I say: “if you think this third-rate transsexual has anything left to say, I hope you know the moment I stop coming will be the moment I stop being able to pay my rent.”
