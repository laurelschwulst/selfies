I am a grateful, beautiful, brown-yellow field of blood and flesh. Alive, living between inhales and exhales, with wheels and cogs, wounds and triumphs invisible to the naked eye. I am a churning seabed of thoughts in a brain, words on a page. I promise I am not a riddle. I am no peril. I am undeniably, like you, an emotional ooze wrapped in red, white, and blue. Believe me when I tell you, I am a home who loves to learn and is learning to love. I am the shape of something that moves and rests. I am a grateful, beautiful, brown-yellow field of blood and flesh.
