A brutally flash lit photo. A white/hapa person with long hair leans over a table and turns to look up at you, reader, through the phone in their outstretched hand above them. Their glossed lips pucker below blushed cheeks. Black mascara and emerald eye shadow lift a unibrow to frame their gray eyes. Hundreds of glistening cockroaches cover a two by three foot sheet cake that sits upon the otherwise empty table behind them. The words "eat me" are written across their forehead in red lipstick.
