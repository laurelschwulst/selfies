Tall, thin, and at an age hurdling to thirty, a woman with shoulder-length brown hair micro-twirls to meet the camera. Her skin catches bright gallery lights and shines the color of vanilla funfetti cake, with freckle sprinkles. Eyes open wide, like a deer in the headlights, sit below eyebrows arched between surprise and concern. One arm extends to meet her hip while the left curls into a flamingo and caresses her shoulder. A billowing hot-Cheeto-red dress matches the color of the goliath-sized brushstrokes coating the white wall behind her like Cheeto dust. Purple socks peek out of heavy black boots with heels that stretch to meet the wide-planked wooden floors below.
