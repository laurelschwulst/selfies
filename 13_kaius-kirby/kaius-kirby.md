Kaius, a white, trans, disabled, intersex person is framed on the left from the waist up. They are wearing a navy button up and a silver chain around their neck. They smile timidly at the camera as the flash washes out their already pale skin and cropped brown hair. Standing in the living room, they look forward to going out dressed conventionally masculine, but are visibly nervous.
