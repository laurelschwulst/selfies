Image Alt Text: Eden, a transfeminine person poses in her mirror, she is wearing a taupe woollen bodycon skirt, white sneakers and trainer sock, a white vest, a beige oversized shirt, and oversized white cardigan. Her hair is pulled into two low hanging buns, and she wears a white beret atop her head. The room is equally white and serene, and she smiles coyly at her reflection through the lens of her phone. In this new form, she feels angelic, almost celestial. Her androgynous features, not quite male and not quite female, reflect a liminal space that within she finds a feeling of home. Her ability to ‘phase’ through the walls defining the binary exhibit a freedom that she has not yet experienced until now. The years of discomfort melt away in this moment as she imagines herself as a role, she has always desired. To her, her motherly attire and satisfied smile reflect a life lived under the swell, but now floating atop the crushing waves to feel herself, and her desired self, at once.
