My face is positioned towards the sky as wide stone stairs in the park lead upwards behind me. It’s the first day of feeling the warmth of the sun; welcoming it, my eyes are closed. As the light pours over my skin, it feeds the surrounding plant life. Grasses and shrubs poke from the soil; they too, look towards the sun. Soft breezes visit through the small hairs around my temples and short ponytail, enjoying the new temperature. Groups of bare trees around the staircase stand eagerly. Remember, they seem to say—fullness is here, waiting.
