Tired eyes with purple half moons underneath that will be puffed full by morning. I’ve had wrinkles since I was seven, cursed by the California sun and all the sick that’s made a home of me. Take it all in stride while my knee still has the strength to bend, while my jaw keeps grip on the teeth inside it. Forgive me my suspicions; I am caught in that tiresome age between being too young and too old to care. I open my eyes and lose the love of being underwater. Halt at every glass surface I see, hatless head and the crystal frame of my untouched body already burned into false memory.
