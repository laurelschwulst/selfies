Candystore, a trans-y white-bodied lifestyle drag queen is standing in profile, looking at the camera over the rims of white cat eye sunglasses, chin just barely kissing shimher bare shoulder in flagrante. It’s called romantic when one’s shoulders are bare. There are also poofy champagne sateen sleeves to be had, a three-quarter turn, lots of golden hair. It’s called glamour when the sunglasses obscure the tired under eye—who really has time for foundation in quarantine? Besides, the “foundation,” my friends, is crumbling. Let’s make a new one! For that, I’ve also slapped on a chunky pair of hot pink python-print platform heels and some workout pants, replete with neon green thong (aka whale tailing) in front of this shelf of old ass books, stunting my way to a workshop mwaw 💋 Oh. What am I reading? #PieceofCake by #BernadetteMayer and #LewisWarsh, two faves!
